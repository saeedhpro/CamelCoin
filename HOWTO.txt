This Help document only for debian-based linux distros (tested on ubuntu >= 16.04 or linux mint >= 18) 
1- first install this reqirements(For debian bases):

sudo apt update 

sudo apt install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils

sudo apt install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev

sudo apt install libboost-all-dev

sudo apt install software-properties-common

sudo apt install libdb5.3-dev libdb5.3+-dev

sudo apt install libminiupnpc-dev

sudo apt install libzmq3-dev

sudo apt install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

sudo apt install libqt4-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler


2- compile source code :
	2.1- cd to src directory 
	2.2- make -f makefile.unix

3- run ./camelcoin-qt on main directory

4- for seed server delete any file in ~/.camelcoin

	4.2- write this statements in it:
		server=1
		rpcuser=username (your account username)
		rpcpassword=password (your account password)
		
5- on other servers it is better to do 1 - 3 then do these:
	5.1- create camelcoin.conf file in ~/.camelcoin
	5.2- write these statements on it:
		addnode=seed_ip (Enter seed server ip)
		
	5.3- run camelcoin-qt with
		./camelcoin-qt
	5.3- go to debug from help menu and go to console tab:
		you can use help command for help
		use "setgenerate ture" for mining camelcoins (if you win you will get 20 CML)
		
6- you can compile source code for windows
